#### Some simple but longer question?What is your second favourite book? What is your second favourite book?

What is your second favourite book?ragraphs are the core building block of
typography online. You want to make sure you've got a good line-height and
horizontal width—aka measure—for good readability. If you stack your lines too
close together, or too far apart, lines become harder to read. Like a staircase
where the steps are too shallow or too steep. The standard line-height online is
something between 1.5 and 2.0 ems. If your lines stretch too far across the page
reading can feel like a tedious marathon. The standard single-column width
online is about 70-90 characters.
